      <h2>3. Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the website is to give Gløshaugen Revy- og teaterlag a
        website wher it is easy to find information about the revue and
        theathergroupe they recently started. GRT's website will contain all
        possible information you need to know, such as genral information, all
        the sub-groups that it is possible to join, the board of GRT and where
        to find them. Our goal is to make a website to spread information and
        news about GRT, and in this way make it easy for the audince to find
        answers to things they wonder about GRT.
      <br><br>
        The websites audience will be everyone who is interested in the revue,
      whether you want to join in yourself or just watch a performance.<br>
        The main audience will probably be students. But the website is also
        relevant for older visitors, for example parents or gradnparants.
        Therfore we can imagine audinces of all ages stopping by the website, so
        it is important to have a neat and clear website where all target groups
        and age groups manage to navigate to the different pages.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Navigation Structure</h2>
      <p>
        The navigation structure of GRT's website can be described as a clique.
        By this we mean it will be posible to access all of the pages included
        in the website, from the homepage via the menu. All the pages will
        contain the menu, which gives you accsess to all pages regardless of
        which page you are on. The menu will also contain a drop-down menu for
        the varios subgroups. This will be visible when the "Blimedlem"-button
        is hovered upon. The subgroups will all be at the same page, so that you
        can scroll down and read about the different groups. You can also
        automatically get down to a spesific subgroup by using the drop-down
        menu and click on the subgroup you want to read about.
      <br><br>
        We choose a clique structure because we think this is the best way to
        make a neat and clear website where it is easy to navigate. Since the
        website audience potentially can be all age groups it is important for
        us to make a user-frindly website, as we think is with a clique
        structure. This will give the user freedom to easyly accsess the
        different pages by clicking around on the website. As shown in the
        figure under whatever page you are on give you accsess to who ever you
        want to visit next, and it's easy to go back to the homepage.

      <h2>5. Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
      <p>
      We have an ongoing theme which is "classy" and "high-end". The font we
      use is called "Korolev", and the standard font size is 30. The client
      also provided 8 different colors which they wish that we use. The color
      codes are: #F2D398 #F2C84B #D9A036 #BF7C2A #8C501B #262626 #000000
      #FFFFFF.<br><br>
      The navigation bar is positioned at a standard place for many similar websites, so that it is easy to find. It is
      in the same color scheme as the rest of the website, but different from the elements nearest so that it is easy to
      spot and catches the user’s eye quickly. In addition, it is used as a separator between the banner and the rest of
      the page. When (clicking? Hovering?) over certain elements in the bar, a list of subtopics will appear, making it
      easier for the user to navigate the site. <br><br>
      The banner is classy and simple. It contains the client’s logo and does not overshadow the rest of the content on
      the pages. <br><br>
      The footer is styled with the same color as the navbar, and the text is styled in the same way. It will include
      links to Facebook, Instagram and Tik Tok, that are portrayed with their standard icons in white, making them stand
      out. It will also include contact information.<br><br>
      The website should be easy to navigate and have all information visible and quickly found. In addition, as the
      client is in need of a serious website, it should look classy and serious, which is why we chose the simple,
      elegant design.<br>

        <section>
          <h2> 6. Content</h2>
          <p>
            These are the separate pages:
          <ol>
            <li>Homepage: homepage.html
              <p>
                The homepage will be the first page that appears when you visit GRTs website. The homepage will not
                include much
                information about the revue, but it will show you this years theme. The page will include both the
                black color and the gold; two of
                GRTs most important colors. <br>
                <br>
                The goal is to intrigue the users of the website. The users will get a taste of what GRT is and what
                is going on. We are making a
                simple homepage, where it is easy to navigate. The page will encourage the user to explore other parts
                of the website. There is not much text on the homepage.
                There is already a lot of text on the other pages, so we are going to stimulate with simple elements.
                Both the navigation bar and the footer is
                made in a gold color. This color will attract users to both social media and other parts of the
                website.
              </p>

            </li>
            <li>About us: omoss.html
              <p>
                This page will provide needed information about GRT. This is where you can read about: how GRT
                started, who GRT is and what GRT does. <br>
                <br>
                The goal of this page is to inform the user about GRT. The about-page will have the same header,
                navitagion bar and footer as the previous page.
                The same elements are used on all pages, to create a common thread. This is a clean page with only
                pictures and text. The text will spread in three
                paragraphs and a picture will make some air in the text. The image in second paragraph on the left
                side will be around 470px by 400px.<br>
                <br>
                At the bottom, before the footer, there will be a photogallery through the use of JavaScript. The
                images will present in a random order. The size will be aprox. 50% or 100% width.
              </p>

            </li>
            <li>The board: styret.html
              <p>
                "The board" is a html-page where you can read about the most important group in the revue. This is the group 
                that plans every little thing, and makes sure that the project runs smoothly. The page will include information about what the board does and who it consists of. <br>
                <br>
                The goal to inform is more than fulfilled with this content. It includes the same template as the rest of the pages, and is made by both text and images. There
                 is little going on on the site, so that the focus is on who the board is. There will be an image under the navigation bar, that shows some of the members in the board. The image wil have 
                 the same width as the header. Further down the page there will be an overview of the current members.

                <li>Actors</li>
                <li>Band</li>
                <li>Writer</li>
                <li>PR</li>
                <li>costume and props</li>
                <li>"Kos"</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The two sections/pages before this have been almost identical. This page has de same template, but includes several pictures. This 
                is the most important html, if we talk about someone who wants to be a part of the revue. This is the place where every subgroup is collected. All the pages will have a navigation bar where you can touch "Bli medlem".
                 if you are on a PC, a scrolling menu will appear when you hover the mouse over "bli medlem". <br>
                <br>
                We will make the scrolling menu with JavaSprict, and the various selections will change color when the mouse is
                 hovered over them. This page is the last page that helps us achieve the goal of the website. The user now knows both who and what GRT is, and hopefully they can place themselves in a group. If the user wants to be a part of GRT, there
                  will be a contactsheet before the footer. The contact sheet will also be made with JavaScrips, so it will hopefully be a little cooler than the current draft.
