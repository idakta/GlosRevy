        <strong>Gløshaugen Revy- og teaterlag (GRT) </strong> <br>

        <br>
        Our client, Gløshaugen revy- og teaterlag (GRT), is a newly started
        theater group in Trondheim. The leader of the group is Jenny Marie
        Ragnhild. We were introduced to her and GRT by Ida Manger (member on our
        webtek group) and we thought it could be a cool project to create a
        website for GRT. Since GRT was established this year, they have no form
        for website. Therefore our goal is to make a website about GRT where
        people can find information about the group, what they do, how to join
        the group, etc.
